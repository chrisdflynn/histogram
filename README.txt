Histogram App
12/12/15

The purpose of this angularjs app is to compute the histogram of an array of values.

The input should be any javascript array, such as:

var x = [1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1];

The output should be a javascript object that holds the count of each value occuring in the array.

For the above:

{
  1: 3,
  2: 2,
  5: 1
}
